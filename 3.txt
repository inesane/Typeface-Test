Given information is that the service has 100 APIs and 1000 users, meaning that there are around 1 million API requests per day

The way that I would store the data would be in 2 different tables.

One consisting of all the APIs and one of all the users.

Connections would be made from table to table, with the number of that API call that the user made.

Every time an APi is made, every detail such as API name, IP, time stamp, endpoint, user credentials, the response body, request body and user ID. There can be a status column as well denoted whether the API went through or failed.

Every time an API call is received, a load balancer enters the necessary information into this table and the status of the API is changed.

Before sending the API back to the user, the response body and status are updated before being sent to the user.

If there is any error, the status is 'Error encountered' else it is 'completed'.

This current schema will ensure that we can track usage across time and see the error rate as well as requested.
